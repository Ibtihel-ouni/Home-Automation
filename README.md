###  **HOME I/O :**
 
 an interactive smart house simulation, being used together with LabView.

 > Its  main goal  is to introduce home automation concepts using a smart interactive house. Equipped with the most common automation devices, [Home I/O](https://realgames.co/home-io/) challenges students to design control solutions and understand the impact of its implementation.



### **LabVIEW :**
